# simple-semantic-search

Note: This repo is a work in progress.

## Overview

This repository provides a lightweight Semantic Search API powered by Sentence Transformers for embedding generation and `sqlite-vec` for vector storage and querying. This container is intended for development purposes only. It allows developers to experiment with and explore semantic search functionality in a local environment.

## Features
- Sentence Embeddings: Utilizes [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net/) for generating dense vector representations of text.
- SQLite Vector Database: Powered by `sqlite-vec` ([GitHub](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)), a vector extension for SQLite, enabling efficient vector storage and similarity searches.
- API Interface: A RESTful API powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that allows clients to submit queries and retrieve relevant results.
